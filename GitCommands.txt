Clone Git Hub in local Computer:

    copy the cloning path from github by clicking the code button with green background color and paste that cloning path by using the command 

    git clone Paste_clone_path_here

    then press enter, then the repository from the remote will be copied to our local machine..


now we have to add the files in to the github how?

    copy the file that you will to post in guthub and paste in the github folder that you cloned.
     and then go to cmd and type the following commands..

        ==> git status // here by this command we will see the files that are modified or different from the remote repository(that is github)
        ==> git add . //here by this command we will add the files that are modified for the next step commiting.
        ==> git commit -m "here type the message why/ what are you modifying here" //here type the message why/ what are you modifying here 
                            so that your collegs who is working under the same project will come to know what this commit is for!.
        ==> git push //here by using this command we will push the files that are already commited to the remote location that is GitHub.

to undo the changes to the file that is already commited?

    inorder to undo the changes for the files that are already commited by usign the following commands:

        ==> git reset HEAD filename //here we will move the file from the commited stage to uncommit stage 
        ==> git checkout -- filename  //once the file is moved from the commited stage to uncommit stage by using the above
                                        command now we use this checkout command to undo the changes that we perfomred.

how to navigate from master branch to new branch?

    inorder to create a new brnach we have to follow the below mentioned github commands.

        git checkout -b new_branch_name

        git push --set-upstream origin new_branch_name

        ANOTHER WAY TO PUSH THE CODE IS:

        git push origin branch_name  //here by using this command we will set the upstream to the different branch branch_name and by this step next time onwards we can directly
        push the code to the same upstream directly by using the command 'git push'

        if you are in new_branch and if you want to push the code to main branch then you have to set the upstream again to main branch by using the 
        command mentioned below..

            git push  --set-upstream origin main

how to switch from one branch to another branch?

    git checkout branch_name

    by using the above mentioned command we can switch directly from one branch to another branch.
